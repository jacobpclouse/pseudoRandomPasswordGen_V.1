# pseudoRandomPasswordGen_V.1
Pseudo Random Password Generator: Complete with Letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers and symbols.

This program generates a random number and then uses that number to select characters in different arrays.
These arrays contain assortments of uppercase and lowercase letters, special characters and numbers

It also checks to make sure that all of the criteria for a strong password are met
(ie: must have an uppercase letter and a lowercase letter, it checks after a certain character length)
